Diameter
========



Diameter computations
---------------------

Let G be an undirected graph :

- Excentricity: exc(x) = max_{y \in G} { distance(x, y) }
- Diameter: diam(G) = max_{x \in G} { exc(x) }
- Radius: radius(G) = min_{x \in G} { exc(x) }
- x \in V is a centr of G, if exc(x) = radius(G)

First remarks of the definitions

distance computed in # edges
If x and y belong to different connected components d(x,y) = \infty.
diameter : Max Max Min
radius : Min Max Min

Trivial bounds:
For any graph G : radius(G) \leq diam'G) \leq 2 adius(G) and \forall e \in G.
diam(G) \leq diam(G - e)

These bounds are tight

- If G is a path of length 2K, then diam(G) = 2k = 2 radius(G) and G admits a
unique center, i.e. the middle of the path.
- If radius(G) = diam(G) then center(G) = V. All vertices are centers (as for
example in a cycle).

Applications

Some notes
1. I was asked first the problem in 1980 by France Telecom for the phone network
2. Mark Lesk obtained

- Our aim is to design an algorithm or heuristic to compute the diameter of very large raphs
- Any algorithm that computes all distances between all pairs of vertices, complexity O(n^3), or O(nm). As for example with |V| successive Breadth First Searches in O(n(n+m)).
- Best known complexity for an exact algorithm …



Computing diameter using fewest BFS possible
--------------------------------------------

Data: A graph G = (V, E)
Rasult: u, v two vertices
Choose…

If G is a tree, then this works.

Camille Jordan (1869):
A tree admits one or two centers depending on the parity of its diameter and
furthermore all chains of maximum length starting at any vertex contain this
(resp. these) centers. And radius(G) = ceil( diam(G) / 2 ).

Unfortunately it is not an algorithm : it is not working if it's not a tree

             u
             |
             ⋅
            / \
    a- ⋅ - ⋅   ⋅ - ⋅ -b
            \ /
	         ⋅
		     |
			 v

Si je pars de $u$, je peux trouver $a$, $b$ et $v$.
Si je trouve $v$, j'en repars. Je peux alors trouver $a$, $b$ ou $u$.
Si je trouve $u$, alors j'ai un diamètre calculé de 4 alors que le diamètre est
plutôt 6 (cf a → b).




Data: A graph G = (V, E)
Result: u, v two vertices
Repeat \alpha times:
Randomly choose…



An exact algorithm
Compute the excentricity of the leaves of a BFS rooted in m_1 (le milieu) with a stop condition.
Complexity is O(mn) in the worst case, *but often linear in practise*.

Input: G, u, lower bound I
Output A value M such that D - M \leq k.
i <- ccc ………

Comments:

- Boldi and his group had to parallelize our algorithm and a BFS on the giant
connect component of Facebook would take several hours. But only 17 BFS's were
needed.

- The 4-sweep method always gives a lower bound of the diamter not too far from
the optimal. The hard part is to obtain an upper bound with iFUB.

- The worst examples are roadmap graphs with big treewidth and big grids.



The Stanford Database
---------------------

Stanford large…
http://snap.stanford.edu/data/

- A very pratical database for having large graphs to play with.
- Graphs are described that way : number of vertices, number of edges (arcs), diameter.

Easy extensions

1. To weighted graphs by replacing BFS with Dijkstra's.
2. To directed graphs.

BFS = parcour en largeur

Real applications :

1. 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon. Infact there's someone at 8 edges of Bacon.
2. Diameter of Wikipedia
