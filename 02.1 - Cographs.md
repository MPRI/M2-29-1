Cographs
========

> The class of cographs is the smallest class of graphs containing $G_0 = K_1$

Graphes obtenus à partir de :

- Un seul sommet.
- Union disjointe de deux graphes.
- Union complète (?) de deux graphes.

Série, parallèle ?
On peut les représenter par le graph obtenu ou par l'arbre de création

parallel = connected components
series = co-connected components (connected components of the complement)
Consequence: the naive recogniteion algorithm in O(n(n+m)).

Deux sommets reliés == leur plus petit ancètre commun est une série
Passer au complémentaire : changer série / parallele

Characterisation theorem: Seinsche 1974
> A graph is a cograph iff it does not contain a P_4 (path of length 3 with 4
> vertices) as an induced subgraph.

Note: the cograph of a P_4 is a P_4.

1. A P_4 is not a cograph, i.e : no series or parallel operation can be applied to decompose a p_4
2. Using the series and parallel one cannot create a P_4.
3. Being a cograph is an hereditary property. Every induced subgraph 
4. A graph that contain a P_4 is not a cograph.

Lemma
> If G connected does not contain a P_4 then G admits a series composition.


Twins
-----

$x, y \in V$ are false- (resp. true-) **twins** if $N(x) = N(y)$ (resp.
$N(x) \cup {x} = N(y) \cup {y}$).
$x, y$ are false twins in $G$ iff $x, y$ are true twins in $\bar{G}$.


Why are cograph cool?
---------------------

Using cotrees one can polynomially solve on cographs, NP-complete problems in
the general case:

- Maximum clique
  Consider the cotree as an expression to evaluate with the following rules:
  - put a 1 on a leaf
  - interpret a 1 (resp. 0) node of the cotree as a + (resp. max)

- Minimum coloration
  Same rules

- …
- …

But generalization isn't that easy.
